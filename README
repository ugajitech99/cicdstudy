-------------------------- Welcome to DevOPS Training Repository --------------------------


This repository will be used by all trainees to work on the assignments during training. 

In order to easily manage everyone's work, each user will be required to create a branch with his/her github username and use the same for assignments. Feel free to do this at your free time before training.
In case anybody needs help in doing so, here is the command to create and checkout your branch

git checkout -b <username>
